<p>They say there’s no crying in baseball, but as Barthes points out,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In wrestling, as on the stage in antiquity, one is not ashamed of one’s
suffering, one knows how to cry, one has a liking for tears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will come as no surprise to the reader that I did not enjoy my visit to the <em>World
of Wrestling</em> amusement park. This reporter was confronted with
a twenty-minute-long video exhibition incorporating original footage of
amateur wrestling shows. These clips, spectacles all the way from France,
depict a grotesque subculture among youth and intellectuals
in the early 1970s.</p>

<p>Visual imagery and multimedia presentations surrounding the dogmatic
schemes of these violent and erotic French juveniles comprise the rest of
the museum, and it is not impolitic to characterize the content as
distasteful in the extreme. Readers are warned to attend with extreme
caution and discretion.</p>

<p>The visitor eventually realizes that the amusement park’s namesake, social
theorist and cultural insurrectionary Roland Barthes, is an aesthetically
and ethically questionable purveyor of “natural remedies.” With the
hindsight of the knowledge of his habit of smoking, it seems almost
predictable that his philosophy is so morally repulsive.</p>

<p>The food was not very good, consisting primarily of boiled hot dogs and
watery cola.</p>

<p>My concluding remarks are, predictably, short.</p>
