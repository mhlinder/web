# A Visit to Barthes' *World of Wrestling*
They say there's no crying in baseball, but as Roland Barthes points out in
*The World of Wrestling* [^barthes],

> In wrestling, as on the stage in antiquity, one is not ashamed of one's
> suffering, one knows how to cry, one has a liking for tears.

It is not clear to this reader why torn and rented garments are to be
enjoyed, but I will cede that I lack a worldliness common to all Frenchmen.

[^barthes]: Barthes, Roland. *Mythologies*. 1972, page 16.
